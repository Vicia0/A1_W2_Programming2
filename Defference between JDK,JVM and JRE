A JDK(Java Development Kit) is a programming environment for creating Java applets and applications.
A JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is a software component that is designed to execute other software. The class libraries, loader class, and JVM are all included. To put it another way, JRE is required to run Java programs.
A JVM(Java Virtual Machine) The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a program that offers a runtime environment for Java code or applications. It translates Java bytecode to machine code. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a component of the Java Run Environment (JRE). It cannot be downloaded and installed separately. You must first install JRE before you can install JVM. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine in its entire form.
JDK stands for Java Development Kit, whereas JRE is a software bundle that allows Java programs to run, and JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
Java Development Kit is the complete form of JDK, JRE is the full form of Java Runtime Environment, and JVM is the full form of Java Virtual Machine.
JDK is platform-dependent, and JRE is as well, however, JVM is not platform-independent.
JDK includes tools for programming, debugging, and other tasks. JRE includes class libraries and other supporting files, however, JVM does not include software development tools.
JDK includes the installer, whilst JRE just includes the environment for running source code, whereas JVM is included in both JDK and JRE.
